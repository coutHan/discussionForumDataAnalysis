I now have a fiddle leaf fig, monstera deliciosa, peace lily, bird of paradise, and dracaena plants! \n\nMy question is, can I use my 1-2-2 fertilizer on all these different plants without hurting them? Researching online shows that each one seems to have it's own preferred ratio, but I would love to not have a fertilizer for each plant if I can avoid it."

After a while, I noticed the lower leaves became super delicate and would fall off if I even brushed against them. Sometimes they turned a lighter colour first, but not always, some normal looking ones still fall off. I did some research and it seemed like it might I have been shocking the plant bc I was letting it get too dry between waterings, so I tried to keep it moist between watering with misting (the soil a bit too) but now the leaves are folding, and I\u2019m worried that\u2019s due to over watering. As of now I\u2019m just monitoring the soil and watering when I first notice it\u2019s dry (which seems to happen faster than my other plants because the pot is *so* small). I\u2019d had a humidifier on, but I found that it kept my other plants overly moist. I just don\u2019t know what to do, and would love any advice on what I can do for this guy. Thank you!"

I plan in repotting it this week and am not sure how to go about it. Do I need to take any precautions to keel it healthy? I also may have to cut the roots at the bottom to get it out of the pot. I have some \"tropical potting soil\" to use for it, is that fine or should I go with something else? It's pretty large now so I am a bit worried of any stems breaking while moving it."

I came up with cutting up and open a straw and push the bendy part over the problem area.\n\nI\u2019m wondering if people have any other advice on growing this monster I\u2019m trying to create. For example, the straw trick, or making sure the plant is slightly root bound to stimulate shoots sprouting out. \n\nThanks for any tips and tricks that you can come up with!"

I also have a small indoor pond. \nIn the last year, I had some white flies appear on some of my pond plants and unfortunately decimated them. Since then, they\u2019ve spread to tomatoes, basil, Cana lilies, sundew, sage, and my Monstera and pothos. I\u2019ve been using neem oil as well as a mixture of dawn/Alcohol/h2o. I\u2019ve had no luck! I\u2019ve conquered a multitude of indoor pests and have had a tough time getting rid of these. Does anyone have any advice/recipes for a natural insecticide that worked for them?"

        "Text": "I bought this monstera online from someone who propagated it recently. The stems are long and there\u2019s three beautiful leaves but it seems too heavy to support itself. The soil that it was in looks dense and unhealthy so I repotted it in some potting mix. The roots are short (around 5 inches) relative to its height (around 20 inches) which is why I think it\u2019s falling over... I have it leaning on my couch right now for support. If I leave it without support, the entire thing will topple over sideways. I bought a moss pole (awaiting delivery) which would hopefully help. Am I doing anything wrong?? Is this normal? Any tips to encourage root growth maybe?"

So we are having an issue in NYC where the people upstairs suddenly have a child that\u2019s running around all day and screaming, and we can\u2019t focus on WFH or sleep late on weekends. My husband wants to move to another unit in the building which is stressing me out for a few reasons.  \n\nOne is my plants- I only got into plants 6 months ago and now have a thriving calathea beauty star, monstera deliciosa, alocasia polly, birds nest fern, norfolk pine, among others. They\u2019re all growing new leaves even in winter. I found the perfect spots for them- originally calathea was getting crispy so I moved her a few feet further back from the windows.  \n\nMy windows are south-facing now (basically the south living room wall is all windows) and I\u2019m worried since the unit we are considering is the same setup but north-facing. How would this affect my plants?"

They're single stems with one node and a couple leaves that were on their way out to begin with (the plant was too young and damaged to get anything better). Roots have grown directly out of the stem itself (the stem looks hairy). Lo and behold, today I see [baby leaves](https://i.imgur.com/tXlHFnM.jpg) emerging from both cuttings! Hallelujah!\n\nI moved them to leca propagation, but is there any hope of this growing to a full plant from this? Idk if roots growing out of the stems are enough to begin a whole new plant or if I needed 2 nodes, one for leaves and one for roots. Also should I chop off the dying yellow leaves? Idk if they're providing anything for the babies or if they're just taking up resources at this point."

Other than that it's a lovely plant which so far has survived me, which is unusual as plants tend to commit suicide once they learn they're stuck with me."

The dry leaves are still green, there is no brown anywhere.   \nMy room is rather dark, but I make sure to put the plant in the sun for the one hour when a ray of sun finds its way in (around 1pm). I mist several times a day with Brita filtered water. I only watered once, because the soil was moist when I bought it.   \nI am puzzled about why the leaves are drying out.

It's important to me. we even named it Fangorn.\n\nRecently, I noticed some of the leaves drooping and softening, which is strange since normally they're tall and firm. Today I tried gently pulling one of unhealthy looking leaves out and to my horror, an entire clump came out very easily. I then went around the rest of the plant to see if the rest of it was fine... loads more leaves and clumps came out super easily, with just a gentle tug. Now half of it is gone and some of the remaining leaves are still drooping.\n\nHere's an image of what it looks like now: http://imgur.com/a/pRkQmmW\n\nDoes anyone know what to do? I'd like to save this plant if I can. Thanks!"

I know that this is a subreddit about plants, but since plants need sun and this aspect is normally monitored, maybe you can answer my question\n\nIn my room, sunlight hits by bouncing off a white wall towards my stuff something like this, the considered \"Bright indirect light\"\n\n[https://www.ourhouseplants.com/imgs-content/light-guide-drawing-large.jpg](https://www.ourhouseplants.com/imgs-content/light-guide-drawing-large.jpg)\n\nSo I was wondering:\n\nThe infrared/visible sunlight as far as I know, it can heat things up, in summer here we reach temperatures of 35 \u00b0C\n\nDoes this mean that the sunlight would make them catch that temperature (35\u00b0C or above) if i open the windows 1 or 2 hours to ventilate?\n\nThe room temperature usually is 26/27\u00b0C, should I be concerned that it's get quite hot? Someone experienced that the plants gets a lot of hot or something like that?\n\nThanks in advance"

        "Text": "Hello all! Let me preface by saying I'm not really a gardener, and my indoor cats make it pretty difficult to have any wonderful plants inside the house, and I've only ever rented so far. I've had mostly failures with planting and gardening, but I do have a lovely hibiscus bush/tree that I planted in a large fabric pot outside, along with a planter of some lilies. I suck at growing herbs. BUT something strange and remarkable has happened.\n\nAbout a year ago, I bought an orchid plant from Aldi (our grocery store). It was beautiful, it lived for a while, even got that orchid food spray for them too. Flowers shed, but I figured hey, the leaves are still green, let me keep it and see if it'll stay alive. I haven't re-potted or re-planted it because, well, it doesn't really go in a pot of dirt. It's still in the same pot with moss that it's been in since last year, and I've been awful with taking care of it, but I'd water it and spray it with food when I can think of it. It's on the window ledge by the sink, which is the only sunny window we have in the house that the cats can't easily get to and don't really bother going for.\n\nSo here's where my astonishment comes in.... IT'S GROWING BUDS!!! It's got some stems coming out, going a bit sideways, but they are growing buds!!! I can't believe I didn't kill this beautiful creature.\n\nHOW DO I KEEP IT ALIVE?? Better yet, what should I do to help it thrive better? I'm sure the poor roots need some TLC.\n\nPlease help this novice!! TIA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w45i5hh5sqi61.jpg?width=3667&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fdaa0542d15cd6e86102784d584cec5f2a4f82f8"

It recently started to drop leaves, some dry and fall off, but others look perfectly healthy when they fall off. The leaves are mostly being dropped from the inner parts out. I wait until the planter mix is feeing dry-ish before I water, and I have it under a few hours of grow lights until the sun is strong enough in my home come spring. Anyone have experience with indoor lime trees?"

I\u2019m worried that I might be doing it wrong and overwatering my plants, I lost a peace Lily due to root rot a month ago. I water when the top 2 inches are dry."

I have also isolated these plants and  I\u2019m watching every other plant now too. \n\nI don\u2019t know if it matters or not, but so far I\u2019ve only noticed them on 4 of my coriaceous Anthuriums, 1 thick-leaved Philo, and 2 thin-leaves Philos. Maybe they\u2019re more prone to them? \n\nAny tips and info on these bastards and how to eradicate them would be AMAZING, I know they\u2019re a pain in the ass to deal with once they\u2019re established, but since it\u2019s only the early stages and it\u2019s just a couple little white larvae crawling around, I figured I might be able to prevent an outbreak of them if I act fast... I do not want to deal with these once they\u2019re established..."

        "Text": "I bought a calathea eternal flame 4 months ago. It's not even close to being my first plant, and I got some way more complicated plants growing happily for a long time. But this plant. It had gorgeous leaves, but they show all the dust so I have to clean them all the time. New leaves are definitely not as nice as the old ones. Cannot be sprayed with tap water, too much chalk. All the leaf tips are brown. Too much water, too little? No clue. some laves have little scars on them, as if they were folded and snapped or something. And 2 days ago, spider mites. Where did they come from? I checked all my other plants, nothing. Just this one. I literally rubbed every single leaf so I can spray it with Anti-mite thing. It took forever cause even though the plant looks so miserable it has 7 million leaves. What does my plant want?"

I have this plant in front of a west facing window, the soil isn\u2019t soaking wet or dry. The base of the tree looks like it\u2019s bone dry and wrinkling but there\u2019s enough water. The tips are not shriveling like they\u2019re dry the tips just become brown and they don\u2019t look burnt. I don\u2019t know if this is a soil, water, or sun problem. Please has anyone else dealt with this or know how to save this Dracaena?"

        "Text": "Hi all.  My mom died on Tuesday.  She was a huge houseplant person and frequented this subreddit.  She has left behind 85 houseplants.  \n\nShe left some instructions on how to take care of them, and I spent the last year after she got sick learning from her on how to properly care for them (ex watering African violets with room temp water from the bottom).  She also gave away a ton of plants over the past year.  She had probably over 200 plants when she first got sick.  She was the type of person to take a leaf that fell off a plant and put it in water to grow a new plant, so there are multiples of a lot of the plants.\n\nEven though I know the basics, the sheer number of plants has me feeling overwhelmed.  She told me it's okay if some of them die, but I would like to keep as many of them alive as I can, obviously.  Does anyone have any good tips on how to keep track of watering schedules and such?  I will also be moving in the spring so any advice on how to move a buttload of plants across the country is also very welcome.  \n\nShe has a wide variety of plants, from succulents to African violets to spider plants and a bunch of plants I can't remember the names of.  \n\nThank you in advance for any advice you can give me!"

Eeek! I\u2019m sure the eggs hitched a ride in the soil when we brought the tree in for the winter. Will definitely be taking more precautions when prepping plants to come in for the colder months from now on. \n\nSo anyway, my question: I\u2019ve sprinkled diatomaceous earth on top of the soil, but I\u2019m wondering if anyone has any additional tips for getting rid of the pests and making sure more don\u2019t hatch!"

After browsing many nursery website from different country,  I'm taken aback by the price difference of plants.\n\nIn Singapore, you can purchase Pothos N'Joy for as low as SGD$5-$10 , but I've seen some US website selling them for USD$59! Is the price hike only seen in online retailers or are plants equally expensive in physical stores in your country? I'm just curious !"

He will eat every plant I've tried to bring in the house. \n\nHe has destroyed begonias, zz, potatoes ivy, ect. \n\nDoes anyone have some sage advice on deterring my cat from chomping my plants?\n\nI literally just lost all my plants due to the weather since Senior Chomp-o is such a butthead and will eat then the moment they are brought inside. \n\nI want houseplants....but to be fair, the cat was here first."

        "Text": " Hello, a week ago or so I purchased a Rattlesnake Calathea and I just recently (maybe a day or two ago) noticed these spots on the leaves... I'm new to being a plant parent so I'm not sure what all the little spots and things mean. The spots aren't really focused on the outer edges so I don't think that it's being caused by lack of humidity (I have a humidifier and try to keep the room anywhere from 45-60% humidity, but sometimes I forget to turn it on :P). It is still in it's nursery pot and I think the soil is maybe an orchid bark type of thing (?), but it looks like it's well draining so I don't think that's any problem. I've tried to research and I think it might be some sort of a bacterial thing but I'm not completely sure. They are on multiple leaves, (maybe seven from what I can see) and they weren't there when I first got the plant... well I didn't see them there when I first got it. If someone could please help that would be great! I don't want to treat it for the wrong thing and not help/make things worse. Thank you for reading, if you have any idea of what it could be then please let me know! :) \n\n[Weird spots on the leaves ](https://preview.redd.it/55lwv08zemi61.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e81862237cf0a1f053d45cb95fc0ee5b149700d2)"

I have a small ikea greenhouse that we brought into the bedroom we were camping out in and I stuffed as many plants as I could into it. But I have a big BOP, monstera, rubber plant, blue cebu, etc that I couldn\u2019t fit. \n\nI\u2019ve worked so hard to find and properly care for my plants. Do you guys think they might make it? We had to leave our place because my husband and pets simply could not spend a sixth night in the freeze but obviously couldn\u2019t bring my plants. I covered the greenhouse in blankets and tried to put trash bags over the bigger plants before we left tho. \n\nI plan on giving everyone a nice warm drink of water once I can. But idk what else to do. My rubber plant\u2019s leaves all look ready to drop, my monstera looks deflated, my bigger pothos look slightly shriveled. I couldn\u2019t make myself check in the greenhouse because I didn\u2019t want to see how my stromanthe fared. I know I\u2019m losing a calathea and a dieffenbachia for sure and I want to cry thinking about it. \n\nI\u2019m sorry for the long rant. I have left all my items behind because of immigration twice now and never got those items back, so I have a lot of trauma about losing everything again, nevermind something I have poured so much love into. I\u2019m absolutely torn to pieces about my plants. \n\nAny advice I would greatly appreciate."

I took some photos, including prices, and posted those along with my general impressions to my local fb group. I like to let people know if a particular nursery is worth the trip. \n\nKeen eyed members noticed a plant in one of the pictures that is very hard to get at home and quite popular. I had not planned to go back and buy anything but replied that if I had time I might go back and buy some.\n\nNext day enough people had replied that I'm optimistic about buying some, so I drove back on my lunch break and bought fifteen plants for about ten bucks a piece. I went directly to several friends in the group and sold them the plant basically for cost. The remaining plants I listed for twenty dollars and sold them all in short order to happy people.\n\nFor the most part people understand that the time, transportation, and listing are all value added and a plant that has been unfindable locally is available. However I'm getting a lot of shit from people accusing me of being a flipper. What say you?"

If a plant prefers bright indirect sunlight, can it tolerate or even thrive under direct plant light? I have both the colored purple (red and blue mix) and full spectrum grow lights, but this question has always sat in my mind because I have yet to have any plant that has burned in the direct path of the plant lights (I'm talking the light bulb is a foot away from them, it's really close, and it's energy efficient and does not put out heat) & the only plants who have burned are the plants who are in the window. Does anyone have any insight?"
