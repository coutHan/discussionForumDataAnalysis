It came in about a 6\u201d ceramic pot with a layer of sphagnum moss on top of the soil, but I noticed it has no drainage holes. It is quite a nice ceramic pot, so I was wondering if it\u2019s absolutely necessary to transfer it to a new pot with drainage holes if I\u2019m careful about how much water I add? (The snake plant I bought also has no drainage holes!) Also, normally I stick my finger into the soil to check if I need to water my plants. If there\u2019s sphagnum moss on top, is there a different way that I can gauge whether it\u2019s time to water my peace lily or not? Any help is greatly appreciated! \ud83d\ude01"

They started losing leaves pretty mugh right away, and I stopped watering in case it was an issue with soggyness, but they totally dried and it kept happening. I took them out of their pots and the roots were kind of brownish and a little soft and just generally not in great shape. And holding back on water seems to just make it worse. \n\nDoes anyone have any solutions for root rot when the issue is not overwatering? Like a product that has worked really well to help regenerate roots, or another tactic? I have heard about beneficial bacteria, but I haven't been able to find much comparing different options, so I would love to hear from anyone who has addressed this problem successfully. \n\nThank you!!!"

([Pretty green thingy](https://imgur.com/gallery/KeV4MHO)) .Since I\u2019m more of a plant person than a bouquet person i thought about propagating these, whatever they are. They\u2019ve survived really well submerged in water for 2 weeks now and the leaves have nodes (I\u2019m assuming) growing on them. \nSince i\u2019m still a newbie I have 2 1/2 questions:\n1. What are they?\n2. Can they be propagated? and if so, how?"

I'm a bit nervous since I'm more used to the more resilient herbs and succulents.\n\nI've done some research and Azaleas require moist soil at around 16-18 Celsius, that's not an issue with the climate I live in. However it needs acidic soil, and my problem starts here. \n\nNone of the gardening stores are open where I'm at, I live in an apartment with no access to soil unless I want to do a midnight heist on the park nearby, I've tried searching everywhere for soil acidifiers and couldn't find any. Lockdown due to covid won't lift until well into March and I'm worried the flowers won't last that long! \n\nAre there any home DIY methods I can utilise for now? Can I water it with diluted lemon juice? \n\nAdditional info: \n1. I've placed the plants by the window where they can get around 2-3 hours of sun everyday. Unless it rains, Irish weather.\n2. I keep the room at around 16 Celsius ( i think that's 60F?)\n3. I haven't started on fertilisers since i don't have additional soil or pots to mix things up, will move to a bigger wider pot the moment shops are open."

        "Text": "Hello everyone,\n\nI started to grow some basils and lettuces hydroponically at home during the stay-at-home period. Since the plants were a little far away from my living space, I was too lazy to take a look at them frequently. So I worked with my friend to build a sensor box including a camera, a temperature & humidity sensor, and a water level sensor. We also built a web page to show the sensor data and the real-time photo of my plants. Later, we thought that maybe someone else also had this pain point therefore this sensor box and management software could become a business product. But we don\u2019t want to spend a lot of time and money building a real product and find it useless to others. So we would like to ask if you have the same pain point? If not, what\u2019s yours? Maybe we can also solve them using these technologies.\n\nThank you!\n\n**If you like this idea and want to be an early adopter, feel free to send us an email:** **seedarray@outlook.com (no spam).**\n\nBelow is a simple diagram of our idea.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[System Diagram](https://preview.redd.it/spxc4kwg84i61.png?width=628&format=png&auto=webp&s=5604b787fb54570919d1d32353c33d582ae756bb)\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the website.

        "Text": "My corn tree is the victim of my novice for the plant (and houseplants) and a drafty house. (How do I post a pic?) It came to this point about a month ago after irregular watering, room temperature and humidity variences, and a repotting to check for root rot (which it didn't not have). I've been very consistent with watering since the repotting. I water when the top 2 in are dry, and watering from top to  bottom until water comes from the bottom of the pot. It has been in a room with bright indirect light and temps 55-62, humidity 50-52. The canes are both solid when I try to squeeze them. The leaves have never dropped on their own. I did clip a few off when they started to brown, bases on info I read online. Overall, it hasn't changed for good or bad in the past month. I thought it may be very dormant because of my care mistakes, and the winter time. Insights regarding this corn plants ability to revive, and what is needed to do it, are greatly appreciated.

The succulents all use their own fertilizer and seem to be doing great, I've even been able to propagate some! My question is, is would the African violet fertilizer (7-10-7) be suitable for the other 2 plants or should I just go ahead and get another more general fertilizer?"

For example this one is on sale, but I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s the same thing: Neptune\u2019s Harvest Fish Hydrolysate.

When you get things right, it can be a truly rewarding experience. But when growing at home, not everything will go according to plan.\n\nOne area where things can often go wrong is during seed germination. Many new gardeners don't really take the time to consider what this process requires. So here are some simple tips to help you germinate seeds successfully, whether you are sowing them indoors, or directly into your garden.\n\nA Good Garden Needs Good Seeds\nFirst of all, in order to achieve good germination rates, you need quality seeds. Of course, you can save your own seeds from heirloom or heritage crops. But if you are buying seeds, you always need to consider the source.\n\nMake sure you choose seeds from a reputable supplier. And, ideally, source seeds from as close to home as possible. Seeds lose viability over time, and if stored or transported incorrectly, can yield poor results. Make sure the seeds you choose are suitable for growing in your area, and in your particular garden. (Check with your local cooperative extension service for advice on what may be, or may not be, suitable for your area.)\n\nGood Germination Rates Depend on Environmental Conditions\nOnce you have your seeds, remember that you too will have to store them correctly. Then you will have to make sure that you provide the seeds with the environmental conditions they need to germinate successfully. Even when the environmental conditions are not perfect, you can still get plants to grow. But boosting germination rates by optimizing conditions can increase the yields possible from your garden.\n\nHere are some important things to think about when trying to make sure conditions are ideal:\n\nWater Requirements For Germination\nMature seeds typically need to rehydrate. This means that they will take on significant amounts of water before they can begin the germination process. As the seeds take in water, hydrolytic enzymes are activated. These begin to break down the food stored within the seed so that metabolic processes can take place. Water also softens the seed coating, allowing a seedling to emerge.\n\nThe amount of water required will depend on the type of seed you sow. Water too little, and germination cannot take place. But water too much and this can also cause a range of issues. Water needs tie in with the next requirement \u2013 oxygen. Ensuring that both water and oxygen needs are met is crucial in ensuring good rates of germination.\n\nSeeds Require Oxygen For Germination\nBefore seeds develop leaves, most of their energy comes from aerobic respiration. In other words, seeds need oxygen from their environment for metabolic processes to take place.\n\nWhen insufficient water is supplied, the coatings on some seeds may not be able to break down. Sometimes, this is necessary in order to allow seeds to take in water and oxygen from their environment.\n\nBut overwatering can cause waterlogging and compaction. Which can mean that seeds are starved of the oxygen they need.\n\nIn terms of oxygen needs, it is also important to make sure that seeds are buried to the right depth. If a seed is buried to deep, this might also make it more difficult for oxygen to reach them. (Some seeds also need light for germination, and so must be placed on the surface of the soil.)\n\nMake sure to consult the seed package or information elsewhere to check how deep to sow and other requirements for the specific seeds you are planning to geminate.\n\nChoosing The Right Growing Medium\nAn important part of making sure that water and oxygen needs are met is choosing the right seed starting growing medium. The potting mix that you use for general purposes, or for mature plants in containers, will not necessarily be suitable for seed starting.\n\nA seed starting medium can either be soil-based or soil-less. But it will usually need to have a finer texture than a typical all-purpose compost or potting mix. The texture and structure of the mix must remain moist, yet be free-draining enough to prevent waterlogging and compaction. Though if you are sowing seeds to pot on or transplant fairly quickly, it does not need to be particularly high in nutrients.\n\nTo keep your gardening as sustainable and eco-friendly as possible, make sure you choose a peat-free option. Peat is a valuable carbon sink and its ecosystems are crucial in maintaining biodiversity and the world's water cycle. It cannot be naturally replenished as fast as gardeners are using it. So we should leave it where it is, protect those precious ecosystems, and use alternatives in our gardens.\n\nHomemade Seed Starting Mix\nThe most sustainable option is often to simply make your own seed starting mix. For most of my seeds, I use a mix of:\n\n1/3 homemade compost\n1/3 leaf mold\n1/3 loam (garden soil)\nHowever, you can also make a soil-less mix to make sure you avoid issues with fungal diseases like \"damping off,\" and weeds. Composted woody materials, or coconut coir, are materials often used for this purpose. It is best to try to choose locally available materials to reduce your negative impact where possible. But always keep the basic environmental needs of your seeds in mind.\n\nSeeds Need the Right Temperatures\nAs well as thinking about oxygen and water, and the growing medium that provides optimally for these needs, you also need to think about temperatures. Where and when you plant is crucial to make sure you provide the right temperatures for germination.\n\nMost common annual crops have a minimum germination temperature of roughly between 36 F and 60 F degrees, but also have optimal ranges. Optimal germination temperature ranges can vary significantly for different crops. For example, parsnips will germinate best between 50 F and 70 F degrees. And, towards the other end of the range, aubergines will germinate best between 75 F and 90 F, tomatoes between 61 F and 86 F, and peppers between 64 F and 95 F degrees.\n\nWhen sowing indoors, heated propagators may be required for best results for warm-season crops, depending on the temperatures inside your home. When sowing outdoors in cooler climates, sowing too early can result in much lower germination rates. So these are very important things to think about if you want to achieve the best possible results.\n\nThere is, of course, a lot more to learn about the specific requirements of different seeds. But thinking about these basics will point you in the right direction for getting the best germination rates possible, and get your garden off to a good start this year.\n\n\nWhich Gardening Approach Provides the Highest Yields?\n\nStart Sowing Early To Extend Your Growing Season\n\nWhen This Smelly Corpse Flower Bloomed, Did It Make Gardening History?\n\nWhat to Do if Your Grass Won't Grow\n\nHow to Get the Most From a Small Garden\n\n10 Best Herbs to Grow Indoors\n\n22 Beautiful Patio Plants Anyone Can Grow\n\n20 Unique Indoor Trees to Spruce Up Your Space\n\nBiodegradable vs. Compostable: What's the Difference?\n\nColor in Kitchen Gardens: Growing a Rainbow For Cheer\n\n12 Large Indoor Plants to Make a Green Statement\n\n15 Indoor Plants That Can Handle Low Light\nSustainability for All.\nSign Up for Our Newsletter\nOne-Tap Sign Up\nFollow Us\nFacebook\nTwitter\nInstagram\nPinterest\nEnvironment\nBusiness & Policy\nHome & Garden\nNews\nAbout Us\nAdvertise\nPrivacy Policy\nCookie Policy\nCareers\nEditorial Guidelines\nContact\nTerms of Use\nCalifornia Privacy Notice\nTreehugger is part of the Dotdash publishing family."

        "Text": "Hello,\n\nI've started planting last December or January. I bought some loam soil mix of cocopeat, worm castings, garden soil and sand.. Feels good to the touch not to compact, not too loose either.  I generally used Pots and containers for gardening. The pots are placed outside the house altho no direct sunlight is reaching. Here were my experiences:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPak choi - These were stunted, some were leggy (which make me think this is due to lack of sunlight). Most eventually died when I noticed some bugs were flying around the plant.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGarlic - I planted cloves on to a container. These were the easiest I encountered growing. However, I noticed the leaves are already turning brown on some areas which I think is nearing harvest. The problem is that they don't appear to grow more cloves.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTomato - They are fine. however are stunted. It's been around a month and the leaves still haven't grown much\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEggplant - they are fine. however are stunted like egg plant.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI feel pak choi is very very hard to grow. also pests and little sun light. here are some of my questions:  \n\n\n1. How do i prevent my plants from getting stunted? is it due to lack of nutrients? or pests?\n2. Do garlic really need to have a very cold area to grow cloves?\n3. What are good homemade pesticides. like made with household items."

        "Text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI'm installing a couple mounted wall shelves today in my plant corner today and was hoping for some help on grow light placements... I don't get any natural light in that corner (or much throughout my place, actually -- all north-facing windows and I'm in a first floor apt with a building behind me) unfortunately, so grow lights are a must regardless of season. So far I've been using two [24w LED Sansi](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PTZ4TWN/ref=emc_b_5_t) grow bulbs and my plants have been responding really well to them! One in a floor lamp with adjustable neck (pointing down towards plants) and the other in one of those clamp shop lights (more pointed towards the wall/down towards the plants since it's coming from the side) because as of right now, all of my plants are on my round table in the corner of the room -- hence, why I'd like to install a few shelves to free up some room on the table and to be more visually appealing.\n\nWhat I'd like to do is attach one of the bulbs to a [hanging pendant cord](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B079FHFK8N/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and lower it to cover the succulents I'll keep on the table & then keep the other bulb in the floor lamp, but direct it towards the wall (see pic below).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x58vvb80jhh61.jpg?width=1125&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4f9f683c6510fc16bc7b00b4734a7e381e07f7e8\n\n**My question is.... will the plants I'll have on the wall be ok with their light coming from the side, as opposed to from above? If I rotate the plants regularly, they would still - theoretically - get the same \"light\" as if they were in a window where the sun hit from one side... right?** Also, if helpful to know, I plan on putting my low light tolerant plants on the shelves, although Sansi claims their full spectrum bulbs give the same intensity of light no matter which part of coverage area the plant is in.\n\nAlternatively.... I have a second hanging pendant cord and I could put the other light in that, hanging it higher, instead of the floor lamp? (it would actually be higher than what I drew in below - I just didn't include the entire height of the wall in the pic)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vv23rur2jhh61.jpg?width=1574&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4745a3bbae747dd6ba36853ad914a2075c104461\n\nWhat do you guys think??"

This was on Wednesday. \n\nThey just dropped it off and when I pulled the nursery pot out of the decorative pot, I saw it was sitting in 2\" of water. I've allowed it to drain as much as possible, and currently have it in a less humid room to allow the water to evaporate quicker.\n\nIs there anything else I can do to keep the plant healthy?"

Has anyone ever seen anything like that/have any idea how I could jerry-rig one if they don't exist?"

So I built some corner shelves and want to put cascading vines or flowers on it and was looking for suggestions on flowering vines that grow downward if there are any that can be grown indoors? \n\nI\u2019ve been googling a bit and from what I\u2019ve find I\u2019m leaning towards jasmine, white moon flower, black eyes Susan\u2019s, or a type of morning glory. I was going to do a pathos or English Ivy but I don\u2019t have any plants that flower! \n\nJust for clarification the the corner shelf\u2019s are between two windows on each wall so there will be plenty of sun, albeit indirect. \n\nThanks for any help in advance!"

Its been over a year in this place and a few weeks ago I found mold in a closet. I had an inspection done and it was  *Cladosporium*  . which I keep finding can be found on plants. Does anyone have a similar experience? How did you handle it? The mold company I spoke to- I alerted them that I had a lot of plants and knew I had high humidity but they didn't mention anything about that mold being related to plants. Pleas help!  I am planning to get a UV air purifier to start to kill the spores in the air and I used bleach to clean the walls windows and ceilings in and around the affected area."

        "Text": "Hello, everyone. This is my first post here. I just started to buy and take care of plants (lockdown boredom) and since then I mostly focused on cactuses because I was too scared of having fragile plants and killing them accidentally... Yesterday while jogging I saw my neighbor cleaning his vacant lot and I noticed lots of curious looking plants like the one in this picture and asked him what was that and if I could take one home. He said he didn't know its name, but gave me one. I tried to research its name but Google Lens kept giving me different results that don't match this plant's looks. The leaves smell really good and the touch feels velvet-like. Could anyone please help me to identify it and take care of it? I live in the northeast portion of Brazil, it's really sunny in here during most part of the year, but it's currently rainy season. I have no idea if I should keep this beauty indoors or not. Anyways, if anyone could help me it would be much appreciated :)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nwfpy56urwg61.jpg?width=462&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=24400e7c90729e8cc51733aef43b8888318fd5ad\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;"

If not, I'll return the above. I've seen this one recommended here as a better one: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B019ETLC7M/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_fabc_9H9S6G4WY6PKHP3K9RGX\n\nI'm thinking of getting an adjustable shelf from Home Depot or something and then some lights I can mount on it.. But not sure which lights. I can see these cheaper ones too, but not sure how to evaluate: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07QCT6Q4T/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_fabc_29RSJRANZR5W7R54GR47\n\nAny suggestions are helpful! I don't have a set budget but would like to stay under $300 if possible - and can do more if it's something durable enough to use long term in our future house.\n\nThank you!"

        "Text": "Hi there! I noticed that some of my succs and other plants (a snake, a spider, and a few others) are giving mixed symbols about watering lately. I\u2019m struggling to remember when I watered each and when they\u2019ll need water next due to having so much stuff on my mind right now. I think Having a water meter (hydro meter?) would be really useful, but I don\u2019t know which one to get. There are some that also measure the pH of the soil and the light. I\u2019m hoping for one that I can stick in the soil, let it sit for a minute, get the reading, and move it to the next pot, so I don\u2019t know if those fancier ones would work as they might need to sit permanently in the pot to get a good reading. \n\nDoes anyone have a water meter for indoor plants that they\u2019d recommend?"

We want to learn your feedbacks on this idea and see if it's worth us putting more effort on it.\n\nThe idea is to build a sensor box and a management software for the home and small indoor growers. The sensor box can take photos and measure temperature, humidity and water level. The data are periodically uploaded to the cloud service. Growers can monitor the devices and plants through the web dashboard.\n\nWe hope this can help indoor growers to quickly set up a smart hydroponic growing system with the sensor box, software and off-the-shelf growing tools.\n\nFeel free to share your comments. Really appreciate your feedback!"

My plants were too cold, not getting enough light and too much water, which resulted in them flopping over, becoming leggy and growth slowed. A week ago I put them directly under a UV plant bulb in a warmer spot and they've been growing much better but won't stand up straight. How can I fix this? Should I repot?

        "Text": "Hi guys, I started noticing these little guys after I purchased some coconut husks off of Etsy.  I think they may be wood mites; however, I would really appreciate any help on ID'ing them.\n\nThey do not seem to be harming my plant and are always on the move.  I only ever see one randomly walking along the outside of the nursery pots and occasionally walking across the top of a leaf.  I have found no webbing or seen any congregating in groups.\n\nI do clean my leaves regularly and regularly give them all treatments with Neem oil.  When I first noticed them I freaked out and sprayed them down with Safer's End-All; however, the next day I would still see 1 walking along the outside of the pot, which makes me think they may be dwelling in the substrate itself.\n\nSorry these pictures are so bad.  I managed to trap one on a sticky trap and used my loupe magnifier to try to take a picture with my phone.\n\nThank you for any insight/help!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ht6ogqdb35g61.jpg?width=1262&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e8eeddc072244c8a4be556d6dc773668124c2363\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/erddp3ef45g61.jpg?width=573&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=084bcfa97c480e3fc7276979818f540b79f1dd55"

        "Text": "Hello there ! First post on Reddit !\nI have a few questions for you about a project i have.\nPlease forgive my mistakes in english if i make some.\n\nI plan to build my own coffee table with a glass table top, including a kind of watertight box made of plexiglass under the glass. In this plexiglass box i plan to put moss or small plants, recieving the light through the glass, and i  would water them. The air would still be able to reach the plants (the watertight plexiglass box would have no closing top).\n\nSo my question is : what kind of soil would the moss like to live (i've read that some mosses don't need soil, is that true?)? Could i put some little plants in this and what kind of species would fit?\nThe table would be placed in front of a window.\nThank you for reading,\nWaiting for your answers !"

        "Text": "I've been growing several monstera, banana plants, bird of paradise, money trees, and a canna lily for several months in my sunroom and mostly things are going great but I'm fighting what seems like a losing battle with spider mites. Issue started in September when spider mites showed up on a new addition canna lily (lesson learned too late, quarantine new arrivals). Spraying with insecticidal soap several times and trimming the dead leaves revived it and seemed to solve the issue, but in November they showed up on one of the banana plants. Same approach seemed to work, but getting a full treatment on the big plants was hard and through January I was still seeing mites and doing regular sprays and removing them by hand. Just when it seemed like it was dying down they showed up on the other banana. Recently I've tried using humidifiers next to the banana plants as well, and that helps but doesn't seem to be enough. The room isn't isolated from the rest of the house so I can't really keep the humidity up in the whole room. Now they're back on the canna lily and its neighbors. Will I ever win this battle? How? Should I just burn down my house for the insurance money?\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/DzX0oUC](https://imgur.com/a/DzX0oUC)"

The next day my house smells like crap. It's too cold to move the plants outside or into the garage. Would it work to flood the pots in a slop sink and top them off again with fresh potting mix or is there a better way? Also, does organic veg fertilizer exist that won't stink up my house next time?"

I just want to light a benjamina ficus but it is exposed on the north side, which is not enough for this plant. So I would like to know if a top of the range COB Cree CXB3590 for example could increase the growth speed of the plant ? thank you."

BECAUSE IT IS SO DRIED. \n\nI considered actually replanting them but I\u2019m worried that they might not survive due to roots damage. \n\nAny tips? Thanks!!"

It came home with me from Home Depot with LOTS of damaged leaves (holes in a lot of them assuming from sunburn, large brown spots, torn leaves etc). Since I have had it, all of the new growth is beautiful and healthy but overall the tree just looks sad because of the prior damage. I know that a lot of people just cut the top off of their flf trees with no issue, but I can\u2019t find much information about cutting the whole thing down while leaving the roots and about 2 feet of trunk potted. What would happen?"
