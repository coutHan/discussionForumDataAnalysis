Posts asking for help in identifying a plant: posts.txt

## Observation
After crawling through 1,790 posts (maximum amount of crawling under the "New" section) on two subreddits (houseplants and IndoorGarden), we found that only 79 (4.49%) were asking for help in identifying a plant.

## Insights
Perhaps the user’s primary concern is not the identification of plant species.
Based on the word cloud, we know that most of the posts are about sharing plant owners’ experiences with (new) plants and asking for help.

## Decision
Based on the word cloud, we probably won’t want to make plant identification the purpose of our app.
